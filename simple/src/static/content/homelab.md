### Setting up Kubernetes and deploying a few things

I bought a Raspberry Pi at the beginning of Covid like everyone else, but it has been
gathering dust. Recently, I had a burst of inspiration (i.e., I
was watching reality TV with my partner and wanted something to do with my hands) and
decided I wanted to host `ianmyjer.com` from my house. So, I tried to set up something
basic (but still reasonably robust) using technologies I don't work with regularly so
I could learn something new. Here's the setup as it stands today:

* **Kubernetes:** I use AWS ECS/Lambda and Docker a lot at work, so I wanted to try
  Kubernetes at home. I'm using `k3s` but I'm running my own `traefik` and I'm using
  `metalLB` instead of `serviceLB`
* **Cloudflare:** Cloudflare is my domain registrar which allows me to use [Cloudflare
  Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/).
  I followed [this doc](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/many-cfd-one-tunnel/)
  to run the tunnel as a kubernetes workload. Cloudflare automatically (and freely)
  handles TLS certificates for `ianmyjer.com` and some static asset caching which is
  pretty cool!
* **Traefik:** I'm directing all Cloudflare Tunnel traffic to `traefik` because I wanted
  to learn how to use it. I'm using Traefik's `IngressRoute` for hostname and path
  prefix routing. I deployed `traefik` using Helm because the Helm Chart is maintained
  and was easy to follow.
* **DNS Sinkholes:** I got a bit carried away reading `r/selfhosted` and `r/homelab` and
  ended up deploying `pihole` as a Kubernetes workload for local ad
  blocking (I also tried `blocky` and `adguard home` but pihole has the best
  documentation). Because I'm using `metalLB` instead of the built-in k3s `serviceLB`,
  `pihole` has its own LAN static IP within my home network. This
  allowed me to set it as a DNS server on my router's DHCP configuration, which has
  been particularly nice for blocking requests from my "smart" TV. I opted to
  deploy `pihole` using a manually written Kubernetes Manifest because I didn't like the
  Helm chart.
* **Tailscale:** I got annoyed having to type `<local IP of Pihole>/admin/` into my
  browser so I could sigh with satisfaction that I had blocked <1% of the data collected
  about me. So, I started using the `tailscale` kubernetes operator with [cluster
  ingress routing](https://tailscale.com/kb/1439/kubernetes-operator-cluster-ingress).
  This means private services like pihole and Traefik's admin dashboard are available
  (with HTTPS!) within my tailnet (but not publicly!). I'm also running tailscale
  directly on my raspberrypi itself.
* **Security:** Maybe the nicest part of this setup is Cloudflare Tunnel +
  Tailscale allowed me to not open any router ports publicly. I can `ssh` to my
  raspberypi using my LAN static IP when I'm at home or via `tailscale ssh` when I'm not
  at home if necessary. It's very nice that Cloudflare and Tailscale are free
  for personal use like this!
* **Professional Stuff:** I briefly had prometheus/grafana running via the Helm chart
  but they were using valuable resources on my raspberry pi and I'm never
  going to check the monitoring anyway so I took it down. I also thought about setting
  up CI/CD but I spend a lot of time with Github Actions at work so I backburnered that
  idea üôÉ.

TL;DR - all "public" traffic goes Cloudflare --> Cloudflare Tunnel --> Traefik -->
Kubernetes Service. All "private" traffic is either to static LAN IPs (courtesy of
MetalLB) or via Tailscale. No router ports were opened in the making of this "homelab"

### Ian Myjer Dot Com

I use Javascript/React at work but it's not my strength and I didn't feel I needed
something so fancy to convey basic information about myself (one could certainly look at
the sorry design of this site and argue exactly the opposite, but I did get good marks
on the Google PageSpeed Insights analyzer so ü§∑). And, I use `Express.js` at work but
wanted to try out `go` so I decided to deploy this website using 
[Fiber](https://docs.gofiber.io/). Plus, their benchmarks say it's super fast which is
ultimately what's important for websites, right?!

I also saw a post on HackerNews about
[hellpot](https://github.com/yunginnanet/HellPot) which I thought was hilarious so a few
endpoints [https://ianmyjer.com/robots.txt](https://ianmyjer.com/robots.txt) are
actually handled by hellpot instead üçØ.
